# Sorting-Algorithms-Visualizer

Hiya! I made this visualizer to develop a further understanding of some popular sorting algorithms and to get more accustomed to creating a GUI in customtkinter. 

## Supported Algorithms

**Insertion Sort**: builds a sorted array one iteration at a time, compares next element to elements in already sorted portion

**Selection Sort**: finds next smallest element, brings to the front after already sorted portion

**Bubble Sort**: "bubbles" the next largest element to the right, swapping when the left element is larger than the right element

**Merge Sort**: recursive sort, breaks array into smaller arrays and "merges" them back together in sorted fashion

**Quick Sort**: recursive sort, utilizes a pivot bringing smaller elements to left, and larger elements to the right of pivot

## Using the application
